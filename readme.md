What's up?

Nothing interesting around here, so... Why are you reading my README?

Oh, true, it's named "README", thats why.

I guess I have to say something here...

1. Only using GitHub for downloading apps or creating issues.

2. Not a programmer, but I love technology. 

3. Windows user. 

4. Don't you have anything better to do?
